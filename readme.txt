= Why Give? =

Prior to Give there was no single go-to solution for accepting donations on WordPress. Sure, Gravity Forms and WooCommerce are great plugins but they're not developed to work specifically with donations. This can often lead to your users being confused by unnecessary cart systems, incorrect terminology, or lack of giving flexibility. As an admin, you may have experience wrestling with the various other WordPress donation plugins. Dealing with the lack of documentation and support can be a real pain. There's a better way. Now you have Give.

= Simple and Pain Free Giving =

Give works great right in WordPress in a way that you're already familiar in working. Simply install and activate the plugin to get started. The backbone of Give lies within its forms. Forms are what allow you to accept donations anywhere on your website. When creating a form you may specify whether the form is a single or multi-level amount. As well, forms can accept a user provided donation amount.

= First Time Users =

For new users, we suggest reviewing our [documentation](https://givewp.com/documentation "Visit the Give docs") to get an understanding of how the plugin works prior to using it. If you run into any trouble, [support](https://givewp.com/support "Visit the Give support page") is here to help you with your issues, questions, and concerns.

= Zero Commission Charges =

We earn money by selling add-ons. The money you raise using Give is yours to go to support your cause. Period. Add-ons are premium features that enable you to extend the functionality of Give. For example, you use one of our add-ons to accept funds through your favorite payment gateway.

= Easy to Customize and Enhance =

Give is built by [WordImpress](http://wordimpress.com "Visit the the developers of Give - WordImpress"), our plugins are built from the ground up to be intuitive and easy to use. Along with the plugin is a support team that is dedicated, fast to respond, and always willing to squash bugs and help troubleshoot.

= A Tribute to Open Source =

*"Open source software is software that can be freely used, changed, and shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone. Open source software is made by many people, and distributed under licenses that comply with the open source Definition."*

**~ The Open Source Initiative**

Give is a tribute to the spirit and philosophy of open source. We at WordImpress gladly embrace the open source philosophy both in how Give itself was developed, and how we hope to see others build more from our code base.

Give would not have been possible without the tireless efforts of these open source projects and their talented developers:

* Pippin Williamson and his wonderful development team, Easy Digital Downloads
* Mike Jolley and the whole WooThemes Team, WooCommerce
* Carl Hancock and his entire crew, Gravity Forms
* Joost De Valk and the Yoast team, WordPress SEO
* Justin Sternberg and the whole WebDevStudios team, CMB2

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 3.8 or greater
* PHP version 5.3 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0.15 or greater
* Some payment gateways require fsockopen support (for IPN access)

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Give, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click "Add New".

In the search field type "Give" and click Search Plugins. Once you have found the plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our donation plugin and uploading it to your server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How is Give better than *Gravity Forms* for accepting donations through WordPress? =

First off, we love Gravity Forms. It's a great plugin and has a lot of good features for accepting donations. That being said, it lacks substantial donation reporting features and requires a developer license ($199/yr) to accept credit card payments on site.

= How is Give better than *WooCommerce* for accepting donations on WordPress? =

We also really like WooCommerce. It's hands-down the most robust eCommerce platform for WordPress. But that's also the issue. Typically you don't need a cart system, shipping, or tax calculations to accept donations. On top of that, customizing the plugin's terminology is a daunting task. You never want your users to receive an "invoice" for the donation "product" they "purchased". Rather, you'd like for them to receive a receipt for the donation they gave. WooCommerce can do donations, but that's not what it was designed for.
